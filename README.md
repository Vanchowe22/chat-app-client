# Chat App Client

## Description
This is client that helps you to communicate with others via specific host and port that you have chosen.
I have used JavaFX for the UI. JavaFX provides a modern, intuitive, and powerful framework for building rich client applications with features like smooth animations and customizable UI components.
The biggest challenge I faced was that there were too many components that I didn't know and I had to acquaint  myself with them in a short period of time while I was also busy with other activities. 

## Setup instructions
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vanchowe22/chat-app-client.git
```
Import the project into your preferred IDE that supports JavaFX development
